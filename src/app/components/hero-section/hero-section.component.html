      I'm a fullstack developer with 3 years of experience building web
      applications at Deutsche Telekom and beyond. I specialize in frontend
      technologies like Angular, React, and Svelte, but I enjoy working across
      the stack. Outside of my day job, I co-founded Code_Craftsmen, a small
      team delivering custom-built software solutions.
